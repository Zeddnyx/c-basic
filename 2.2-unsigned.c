// #What are the advantages of using unsigned int?
// Unsigned int is useful when working with variables that represent quantities
// that should never be negative, such as the size of an array or the index of
// an element in an array. It also allows for a larger range of positive values
// compared to a regular int.
//
// #What is the range of values an unsigned int can hold?
// An unsigned int can hold values from 0 to 2^n â€“ 1,
// where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned int on a particular system. 
// For example, a 16-bit unsigned int can hold values from 0 to 65535.
